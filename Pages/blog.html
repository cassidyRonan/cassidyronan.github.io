                <p class="bold subtitle righteous">Learning C++: The Journey Begins - 04/06/2021</p>
                <p>Now that I have completed my BSc (Honours) in Software Development, I've found myself with a lot more time on my hands while I search for an employment and as somebody who needs to keep busy, I began learning C++ to create a strong base for when I begin learning how to use Unreal Engine.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>In the first week of learning C++, I've found it fairly easy to adapt to the new syntax as there are many parts which are similar to C# making it quite easy to pick up. While I already understand many of the basics of programming from various variable types and object-oriented design, I decided to start from basics to give myself a refresher and in case there were any differences as C++ is a low-level programming language.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Now I'm going to highlight some of the aspects of C++ which I found interesting in my move from C# and what I've learned about them so far:</p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>1. #include&#60;&#62; & using namespace;</strong><br/>
                        When it came to the include statement, I found it strange at first as I was used to dealing with &quot;using Namespace;&quot; from C#. My current understanding is that an include statement allows the programmer to specify a file in the project that can then be accessed for variables and functions depending on their visibility. The strange part of it for me was then having to write using namespace std; for example to actually be able to use the content from that namespace as well as the include or to prefix a variable/function with the namespace such as this &quot;std::stoi();&quot;. 
                      </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li><strong>2. Method Declaration</strong><br/>
                        Having primarily written code in C# for the past four years with the occasional switch off to Python, Prolog and others, I was surprised to find that I wasn't able to simply write a method below my main method and have it run in the main method. In C++, you need to either declare the method above it's implementation like this &quot;double CalculateAverage();&quot; and then define it somewhere else in the code as normal or you can define and declare it above where it will be used. Obviously the first option leads to much cleaner code and it should be noted there is a better way of doing this which I will mention later on in the list. 
                      </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li><strong>3. Headers</strong><br/>
                         Header files made little sense to me at first as somebody is used to having a single file for one class, however the use of Header files allows us to declare a class but not define the actual body of it. Instead we define the body of the method in a .cpp file, this also allows us to circumvent the issue of having to declare the method above the main method as mentioned in point three. Over the course of this week, I've come to understand that it is useful in certain aspects and especially for seperating the interface from the implementation and that it will just take some time to get used to.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>To assist in my learning of the C++ language, I've been reading through Practical C++ Programming by Steve Oualline; published by O'Reilly & Associates as it helps provide some structure to the learning process. As the book is from quite a few years back, I do intend to find a more recent book to update myself on the newer additions to the language since Practical C++ Programming's publications but it acts as a great starting point.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>While I do intend to continue learning C++ in the coming weeks, I also want to branch out and gain more knowledge on SQL as I currently only have passing knowledge and very basic experience with it. So over the next few weeks, I will be expanding my skillset and learning C++, SQL and Java as well as beginning on some side projects for my portfolio. Thanks for taking the time to read this and have a wonderful day, until next time!</p>

                <p class="bold subtitle righteous">An Introduction - 03/06/2021</p>
                <p>Hello! My name is Ronan Cassidy and I am fascinated with how code can be used to solve a variety of problems, it's likely due to my love of puzzles. My coding journey began back in 2012 when I began attending a local Coderdojo and was introduced to Scratch, along the way I've learned various languages, agile development and even how to utilise cloud infrastructure.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Along my journey, I have graduated from the Institute of Technology Sligo with a BSc in Games Development at the top of my class, recieveing the Prize Winner Award for the highest GPA in the class and then again with a BSc (Honours) in Software Development a year later. In that time I have also developed an inventory management application for use in the engineering industry by myself as requested by a client. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>These days I am currently on the hunt for a software development position which provides an oppurtunity to learn and develop new and old skills alike while solving problems with innovative software solutions. I pride myself on my ability to learn new technologies quickly to utilise them in the project I am working on, I may not know it all but I am prepared to learn it all.</p>
