                Project Crescent is an action/adventure open-world game built in the Unity game engine over the course of 4 months as part of a placement project for my BSc in Games Development at IT Sligo back in the summer of 2020. The project was developed by myself and Samuel Colville, the game was inspired by titles such as Final Fantasy, Breath of The Wild and Persona 5. The game was then released on the Itch.io marketplace at the end of the project's development period. My primary role in the project was lead programmer and world designer, however, over the course of the project I took on further development rolse such as model creation and combat designer.

But beware! Bandits have begun attacking people along the roads between towns.

                        <br/>
                        <p>During the requirements gathering section of the project, research was carried out on how players preferred to access their inventory quickly in the midst of battle whether it be a side menu that pops up, pausing the game and going to the inventory menu, using the D-Pad for quick access or finally a radial select menu. Our surveys showed that players preferred a radial select menu which proved to be beneficial to us as it could be easily incorporated across all controller types through the use of a mouse or thumbstick.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The intitial design process of the feature included breaking down common radial menu functionality such as a "dead zone" in the middle of the menu for example so that if a player does not move their joystick or mouse then it will not select any item. While it would have been easy enough to setup the radial menu to just be hard coded to a specific amount of interactions, I wanted to design the feature so it could have a specified amount of wheel segments wether for reuse in another project or giving the player the ability to unlock more radial slots. To accomplish this, I created a formula to break the area of the radial menu up into segments and take input from the controller to caluclate the corresponding segment which would be selected.</p>

                        <br/>
                        <p>As the game was inspired by titles such as TLoZ: Breath of The Wild, Final Fantasy XV and other action/adventure games with RPG elelements, the project team decided early on that the player would be able to collect a variety of weapons to use throughout the game to match their play style. However, given a limited time frame of four months and only two people working on the project, a solution was needed to be able to quickly create weapons with varying damage values, attack patterns and animations to go with each attack pattern step.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>After a large amount of scribbling and doodling on a white board, the Modular Weapon Creation system was born, using Unity's Scriptable Objects to allow for the detailing of each weapons stats, combo pattern and what animations would play for each attack step. This greatly sped up the design proccess of the game regarding weapons as we were able to quicly setup the weapon after importing its model into Unity resulting in only an hour being spent to implement X weapons into the game.</p>

                        <br/>
                        <p>Open world games give players a lot of freedom to travel and explore the world to their heart's content at their own pace. However, having to walk all the way back to the other side of the map can be very time consuming and very boring, for this reason it was necessary to incorporate a Fast Travel system into the game so players can get places nice and quickly ensuring the joy of playing isn't sapped by a long journey.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The fast travel system works by allowing players to unlock fast travel points, when they enter the fast travel menu, an algorithim checks against all Wrap Points in the scene to check if they have been unlocked and only displays the available points the player has seen before. This system allows for game designers to just drag and drop a new teleport point into the scene and it will then be automatically added into the system including the map preview as shown here.</p>
